pclsceleton is a kinect utility combining the point cloud library's cloud viewer and osceleton's joint tracking. 

This lets you visualize the cloud, the joints and output the joint positions as open sound control (OSC) messages.

Check the keys.txt file for the shortcut keys embedded in the point cloud viewer. 

This assumes you've got a working PCL 1.3 installation. For info on that see http://pointclouds.org
